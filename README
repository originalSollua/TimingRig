version 0.1 of timing rig

simple rig to compile and run simple java programs

While it is entierly possible to use the time command to time programs, I want to 
use this as a sarting point for something more interesting.
I want to turn this eventually into a scrpit to process a variety of languags and imput formats.
allowing for files of paths to be found, compiled, ran and timed.
